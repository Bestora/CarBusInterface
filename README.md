# Car Bus Interface

An android application for interfacing with a vehicle's communication bus via Bluetooth OBD2 dongle (ELM327 compatible). It allows the Android device to respond to specific bus messages, such as those occurring when the user presses physical buttons inside the vehicle.

This is an evolution of the [Steering Wheel Interface app](https://github.com/theksmith/Steering-Wheel-Interface), written to be more configurable and for Bluetooth dongles instead of USB.

**Please visit the Wiki for how to get started using the app: https://github.com/theksmith/CarBusInterface/wiki**
