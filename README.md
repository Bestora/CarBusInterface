# Car Bus Interface

Android application for interfacing with a vehicle's communication bus via Bluetooth OBD2 dongle. It allows the Android device to respond to specific bus messages, such as those occurring when the user presses radio control buttons.

This is an evolution of the [Steering Wheel Interface app](https://github.com/theksmith/Steering-Wheel-Interface), written to be more configurable and for Bluetooth instead of USB.

**Please visit our Wiki for how to get started using the app: https://github.com/theksmith/CarBusInterface/wiki**
